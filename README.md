# Workflow:
1. switch to your branch and fetch+merge to update your branch \
`git checkout [your_branch]` \
`git fetch origin` \
`git merge origin/main`

2. backend setup and run \
`cd server`
`npm i` 
`npm run start`

3. frontend setup and run \
open another terminal in vscode and run: (2 servers need to run at the same time) \
`cd frontend-vite` 
`npm i` 
`npx vite dev`


4. coding time! 


5. how to push after code is ready \
cd to the project root directory \
`git add .` \
`git commit -m"your commit message"` \
`git push` // push to your own remote branch \
`git push origin [your_branch]:main` // push from your branch to main \
