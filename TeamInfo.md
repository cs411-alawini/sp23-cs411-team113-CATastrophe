## Project Summary

College Recommendation is a website that uses holistic metrics to find the most compatible colleges and display them in a clean layout for an individual user. Essentially the website will take the user's criteria to find the best college for them. The metrics include level of diversity, location, salary potential, SAT/GPA, tuition cost, and more! 

Our project will utilize college admissions, diversity, salary, and tuition data from US universities to provide students with a college recommendation system. Users will be able to list their preferences for schools (location, diversity, post-graduate salary, etc) and their student profile (SAT scores, GPA, race, gender). We will use this input to rank and suggest universities that align the closest with the userâ€™s background and needs.
